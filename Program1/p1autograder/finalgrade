Below are the grade totals for the first two programming assignments
(p0 and p1).  Your score you see below for p1 will be the same or one
or two points lower than what the autograder mailed out, based on
documentation deficiencies.

If you lost a point, it was most commonly for failing to be clear
WHY you used ungetc().  (WHY, not WHAT: that is, "put the character back"
is already obvious and uninformative; you need to say WHY you want to
read it a second time [e.g., "we just used the character to end a word,
but it might be a word in it's own right, so it must remain available
to the next call to getword()].)

For`the short synopsis at the beginning of getword.c, the getword.h I
gave you already had painstakingly detailed specifications, so 
two sentences could suffice here:
say WHAT you were returning, and mention the side effect (of stuffing
a word from stdin into the indicated location).

From now on, you'll get much more extensive feedback from me.  When I grade
p2 (and p3 and p4), I'll be printing the autograder results in their
entirety, which will include a checklist of things I will be looking at
'by hand'.  In that printed format, you'll be able to see my specific
comments about documentation when I hand back my printouts to you, so
I'll devote perhaps 4 points to your programming style and comments.

The checklist will appear at the bottom of new autograder mailings.
Note that one of the things on the p2 checklist involves your getword.c
documentation -- so if you AGAIN lost a documentation point in p1, you
can expect that it will bite you a third time if you don't fix that up.
And since for p2 I can give you annotated printouts rather than just a
number in a spreadsheet, I may grumble if you've done something particularly
odious in getword() [since getword() will also be a part of p2].  For
example, some people are using memset() to clear the buffer, which is
totally unnecessary -- all that is required is to properly null-terminate
each word as it is collected.

The class average is currently 92%, but that will drop drastically once we
incorporate program 2 grades.  Be careful not to underestimate the amount of
work required for p2!  [The ~cs570/Data2/input* files will gradually appear,
and the autograder may get fancier and incorporate more tests over the
course of the next week or so.

There are now two more entries in the calendar file:
CS570 Program2	Friday, October 4       (11pm 115% deadline)
CS570 Program2	Wednesday, October 9    (11pm 100% deadline)

Our midterm will be toward the end of October, after I hand back the
graded program2 printouts.  We'll take a vote in class regarding the most
preferred day once we get a bit closer, and then I'll publish a study
guide (note that the Exercises on pages 78-88 are already a good study
guide, since they are principally old exam questions).  The class average
typically takes another nose dive once I grade the midterms, at which
point students panic and resolve to hit the extra credit deadlines for p3
and p4.  Your best strategy is to already pretend the midterm was a disaster,
and prioritize p2 this next week to get the free points available at the
early extra credit deadline.  On the midterm, I'll be asking technical
questions about how you programmed your shell (e.g, questions 3, 4, 5 on
Page 80 of my notes) -- so mastery of p2 will also improve your midterm
score.

Pay particular attention to the 'checklist' that will be mailed with every
p2 autograder pre-test.  Go over that and make sure you can tick off every
category [since I will be doing exactly that when I grade your printouts].
If you're unsure what is required for any of those categories, ask!
