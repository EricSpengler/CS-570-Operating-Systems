The following is nearly identical to what the (human) grader will be given
for review.  FULL CREDIT (8/8) on this assignment determines your competency
in C, and whether or not you will be disenrolled for lack of prerequisites.
Any score other than 8/8 means disenrollment (very soon if you are already
enrolled, or immediately after I let everyone in from the wait list).

CAVEAT: if you scored 8/8 on a previous run, email me RIGHT
AWAY if you somehow got a lower score this time, so that I don't disenroll
you by mistake!

Now that this project has been collected:
DO NOT CHANGE OR MOVE ANY FILES OR DIRECTORIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT
if you might want your grade to be reevaluated.  Instead, COPY getword.c
to a different directory if you want to continue to play around with it.
(Indeed, ~/One/getword.c would be a good choice, but remember to set up all
the soft links again -- this time pointing at the stuff under ~cs570/One .)

Test 4... is getword.c documented?
(Your getword.c documentation does NOT have to repeat the specs in getword.h,
but it should contain your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains two
'R's and two 'L's], class (that is, 'CS570'), due date, etc.)
Your comments should help explain what the various parts of your code are doing.
Normally, your comments would be reviewed by a human.  But for this simple
assignment, the autograder merely checks for the class and instructor name.
One point was possible here; your total is now 3/3

Test 5... Does the gradernotes file exist?
Yes.
Your gradernotes file contains:
1:I wrote this code myself with the help of L.S.Fosters "C By Discovery" and the inout2.c file.
2:
3:This program has no known bugs.
4:
5:This program parses through the input stream and extracts out each individual word, returning
6:the size of the word as well as pushing the characters onto the input buffer for display.
7:
8:Eric Spengler
9:09/04/19
10:Dr. John Carroll
11:CS570

The autograder is not good at parsing English (no surprise there), so it
will magnanimously award credit for the mere existence of the file -- but note
that there are _two_ MANDATORY statements you MUST include in this file.
Are you SURE you did that?

One more point was possible here; your total is now 4/4

Test 6: Checking all the soft links (calendar, p0 files):
Is the calendar soft link in place?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0095 carroll 31 Aug 28 08:38 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0095/calendar -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/calendar
Yes.
Is the getword.h soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0095/Zero/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0095 carroll 37 Aug 28 08:51 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0095/Zero/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/getword.h
Yes.
Is the makefile soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0095/Zero/makefile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0095 carroll 36 Aug 28 08:49 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0095/Zero/makefile -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/makefile
Yes.
Is the p0.c soft link in place?
ls -l ~cssc0095/Zero/p0.c
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0095 carroll 32 Aug 28 08:51 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0095/Zero/p0.c -> /home/cs/faculty/cs570/Zero/p0.c
Yes.
Unless ALL these are right, you could LOSE a point here; your total is now 4/4

Likewise, your code should compile cleanly, without any serious warning messages
from the compiler:
Test 7... does your program compile?
make clean; make
rm -f *.o p0
gcc -g   -c -o getword.o getword.c
gcc -g   -c -o p0.o p0.c
gcc -o p0 getword.o p0.o

Test 8... does your program handle the simplest situtations?
Here is the result of ~cssc0095/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input1 :

Your output was:
n=0, s=[]
n=10, s=[no-brainer]
n=3, s=[one]
n=0, s=[]
n=0, s=[]
n=-1, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

To make any differences easy to see, the actual diff command I used was:
diff -a myoutput youroutput | cat -vt

One more point was possible here; your total is now 5/5

Test 9... does your program handle leading spaces and no trailing spaces?
Here is the result of ~cssc0095/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input2 :

Your output was:
n=8, s=[trickier]
n=2, s=[to]
n=6, s=[master]
n=0, s=[]
n=-1, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

Test 10... how does your program react to a premature EOF?
Here is the result of ~cssc0095/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input3 :

Your output was:
n=1, s=[a]
n=4, s=[file]
n=4, s=[with]
n=4, s=[zero]
n=6, s=[lines!]
n=-1, s=[]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

One more point was possible here; your total is now 7/7

Test 11... does your program handle 'done' correctly?
Here is the result of ~cssc0095/Zero/p0 < ~cs570/Data0/input4 :

Your output was:
n=9, s=[isn'tdone]
n=4, s=[Done]
n=7, s=[doneNOT]
n=0, s=[]
n=3, s=[now]
n=4, s=[it's]
n=-1, s=[done]

A diff of the correct output with your output shows:
                              No differences encountered -- CONGRATULATIONS

One more point was possible here; your total is now 8/8

Your grade for this assignment may be adjusted by a (human) grader at the
due date.  Your grade could be as much as three points lower, depending on what
you have put in gradernotes, the presense of 'serious' compiler warnings, and
the quality of your getword.c documentation.
NOTE: Even if you get subsequent downgrades for things like documentation, that
does NOT put you at risk of disenrollment.  If this autograder score is
8/8, you will NOT be dropped.
Success on this assignment determines your competency in C, and whether or
not you will be disenrolled from CS570 for lack of prerequisites.  You
must have a PERFECT (autograder) score on this assignment to remain enrolled.

             ------
Total Points | 8  |  for cssc0095 - Eric Spengler for Program 0
             |----|
             | 8  |
             ------
Congrats, you have 8/8; you will remain enrolled (unless YOU decide to drop!}
A human might adjust your score downward if your documenation is insufficient,
but any such downgrade will not affect your enrollment status.  You're in.
